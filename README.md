Open-source Energy-grid Optimisation Tool

The Open Energy-grid Optimisation Tool (OpEnOpT) is a program to aid in the planning and analysis of energy power systems. It aims to increase an energy system's economic feasibility by optimizing the system's dispatch schedule and, if needed, the power component sizes. 
It currently has the means to model a photovoltaics (PV) integrated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) as well as a power grid, which can be used to purchase and sell electricity. It further includes models for a PV-charger component and the battery management system.

The oiptimization objective is comprised of a cost minimisation approach, where the systems total costs over the simulated time frame, based on a calculation of the PV-BESS levelized costs of electricity, have to be kept to a minimum.
